## Overview of Project

I am excited to announce that I have successfully completed the first task of my virtual internship at CODTECH IT Solutions. The project involved developing a dynamic To-Do List application, where I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and user-friendly experience.

**Key features of the To-Do List application include:**

* *Adding new tasks*
* *Editing existing tasks*
* *Deleting tasks*
* *Marking tasks as complete*

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in:

**Front-end development** : I honed my skills in creating user interfaces using HTML and CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

**JavaScript fundamentals**: I implemented JavaScript functionality to enable editing, deleting, and checking off tasks within the to-do list.

I'm incredibly grateful to CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS for providing this opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. This project has significantly boosted my understanding of front-end development and JavaScript. I look forward to continuing my internship and tackling more challenging projects in the future!
